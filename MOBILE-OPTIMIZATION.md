# üì± Mobile Optimization Plan for FeetSocial

## Current Status
Your app works on mobile, but needs optimization for TikTok/Instagram-level smoothness.

---

## Priority Optimizations

### 1. **Full-Screen Mobile Feed** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Goal:** Make videos take up the full screen on mobile (like TikTok)
- **Current:** Videos are in cards with lots of padding
- **Solution:** Detect mobile, render full-screen vertical videos

### 2. **Touch Gestures** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Double-tap to like (Instagram-style)
- Swipe up for next video
- Swipe down for previous video
- Tap video to pause/play

### 3. **Bottom Navigation Bar** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Goal:** Fixed bottom nav like TikTok (Home, Upload, Profile, Live)
- **Current:** Header navigation at top
- **Solution:** Mobile-specific bottom nav bar

### 4. **Lazy Loading & Infinite Scroll** (MEDIUM)
- Load videos one at a time (not 20 at once)
- Preload next video while current is playing
- Unload videos that are off-screen

### 5. **Video Optimization** (MEDIUM)
- Auto-quality adjustment based on connection
- Smaller thumbnails for mobile
- Progressive loading

### 6. **PWA (Progressive Web App)** (LOW)
- Install to home screen
- Offline support
- Push notifications

## What I'll Build Now

I'll implement **Phase 1** immediately:

1. **Mobile Detection Hook** (`hooks/useIsMobile.ts`)
2. **Full-Screen Mobile Feed** (update `pages/index.tsx`)
3. **Mobile Bottom Nav** (`components/MobileNav.tsx`)
4. **Double-Tap to Like** (update `components/FeedItem.tsx`)
5. **Touch-Optimized Buttons** (update styles)

## Expected Results

### Before:
- üòê Works on mobile but feels like desktop
- Small buttons, hard to tap
- Videos don't fill screen
- Desktop-style navigation

### After:
- üî• **TikTok-level mobile experience**
- Full-screen vertical videos
- Easy thumb-friendly navigation
- Smooth, native-feeling UI

Let's build it! üöÄ
