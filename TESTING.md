2. **Mock Payments**: Skip Stripe setup for now
3. **Local Files**: Skip UploadThing, use local file handling
4. **No Video**: Skip Mux, test images only

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Supabase connection failed"
- Check your Supabase URL and keys
- Ensure your project is active
- Verify RLS policies are set up

### "Upload failed"
- Check UploadThing configuration
- Verify file size limits
- Check network connectivity

### "Payment error"
- Use Stripe test keys
