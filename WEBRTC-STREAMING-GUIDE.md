# WebRTC Browser-Based Streaming Guide

## ✅ What's Been Added

You now have **TWO streaming options** for creators:

### 1. **Quick Stream** (WebRTC) 📱
- **No software needed** - works in any browser
- **Works on ALL devices** - desktop, laptop, phone, tablet
- **One-click setup** - just allow camera access
- **Perfect for mobile creators**
- **Real-time P2P streaming** via WebRTC
- **Low latency** (under 3 seconds)

### 2. **Pro Stream** (OBS/RTMP) 🎬
- **Professional quality** - full control over settings
- **Advanced features** - overlays, multiple cameras, screen share
- **Requires OBS Studio** - desktop/laptop only
- **Best for gaming/desktop content**
- **Streams via Mux** - reliable CDN delivery

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### For Creators:

1. **Go to** `/go-live`
2. **Fill in stream details** (title, description, vault settings)
3. **Click "Create Stream"**
4. **Choose streaming method:**
   - **Quick Stream** → Uses your device camera (WebRTC)
   - **Pro Stream** → Uses OBS Studio (RTMP)

### For Viewers:

- **Click on any live stream** in the feed
- **Video plays instantly** in the browser
- **No software needed** - works on any device
- **WebRTC streams** = P2P connection (ultra-low latency)
- **RTMP streams** = HLS playback via Mux (reliable, scalable)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### WebRTC Architecture:

```
Creator Browser → WebRTC → Supabase Realtime (Signaling) → WebRTC → Viewer Browser
```

- **Signaling**: Supabase Realtime channels
- **ICE Servers**: Google STUN servers
- **Media**: Direct P2P connection (no server relay)
- **Fallback**: Can add TURN server for NAT traversal if needed

### RTMP Architecture:

```
OBS → RTMP → Mux → HLS → Viewer Browser
```

- **Ingestion**: Mux RTMP endpoint
- **Processing**: Mux transcoding
- **Delivery**: HLS via Mux CDN
- **Playback**: HLS.js in browser
